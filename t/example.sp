:INT. COFFEE SHOP - MORNING

A normal Denny's, Spires-like coffee shop in Los Angeles.
It's about 9:00 in the morning.  While the place isn't jammed,
there's a healthy number of people drinking coffee, munching
on bacon and eating eggs.

It is impossible to tell where the Young Woman is from
old she is; everything she does contradicts something she did.
The boy and girl sit in a booth.  Their dialogue is to be said
in a rapid-pace "HIS GIRL FRIDAY" fashion.

YOUNG MAN: No, forget it, it's too risky.  I'm
through doin' that shit.

YOUNG WOMAN: You always say that, the same thing
every time: never again, I'm through, too dangerous.
(imitates a duck) Quack, quack, quack, quack, quack,
quack, quack...

The boy and girl laugh, their laughter putting a pause in
there, back and forth.

:INT. '74 CHEVY (MOVING) - MORNING 

An old gas guzzling, dirty, white 1974 Chevy Nova
a homeless-ridden street in Hollywood.  In the front seat are
two young fellas -- one white, one black -- both wearing cheap
black suits with thin black ties under long green dusters.
Their names are VINCENT VEGA (white) and JULES WINNFIELD
